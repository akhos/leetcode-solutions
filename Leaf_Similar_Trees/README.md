## Problem Description
[Link to problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)
Difficulty: Easy

## Solution
we can trace DFS the trees, and when reaching to leafs we register them in the list. 
This gives the left to right order of the leafs. Then we compare both left to write orders of the 
leafs for the trees to check if they are equal or not
