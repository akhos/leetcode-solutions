## Problem Description
[Link to problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-twin-sum-of-a-linked-list/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)
Difficulty: Medium

## Solution
One solution would be to count the number of nodes; n. Then we create a list of size n/2. We start 
by adding the elements and their twins to the list while we traverse and keep the maximum. 
The running time is O(n) and the space is O(n). We can do this also in one pass, using two pointers
